# Changeis React Challenge

This is a Remix application that I created with

```shellscript
npx create-remix@latest
```

The non-boilerplate files are:

- app/routes/\_index.tsx
- app/src/components/ProductDashboard.tsx
- app/utils/product.ts
- app/utils/product.test.ts

## Dev

Install the dependencies:

```shellscript
npm i
```

Validate:

```shellscript
npm run validate
```

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

Build for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```
